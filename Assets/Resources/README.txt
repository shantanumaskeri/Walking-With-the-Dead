- A nice city sandbox (including contryside etc).

- Day/night cycle: ACHIEVED

- Scavaging food, ammo etc would always be encouraged by daylight.

- A gigantic city. Be able to go into every single building as well as climb everything.

- Randomness! Not being able to count on food or ammo drops in stores would heighten the tension. 

- Sudden zombie attacks.

- Infected! If you do get bitten or scratched, you will zombify within a few days unless somehow cured.

- The zombies have to be dumb, but there has to be a lot of them. Also, the double tap rule. I want to shoot one in the chest, have it fall down, and then come back to life when I try to pass by.

- Customization of weapons, Duct tape a knife to your rifle to make a bayonet, strap a garbage can lit to your chest for protection.

- Being able to change outfits.

- Making it sort of RPG style, not with gaining silly abilities but improving your zombie slaying skills as you go along.

- Multiple types of zombies with different abilities.

- Characters equipment improving over time and maybe his or her stats too would be pretty awesome.

- Limited amount of ammo.

- Use anything as a weapon. For example, a roulette wheel, tire iron, pencil, tv, box cutter, headphones (strangling), etc. as a weapon. Stationary objects as weapons for special attacks, such as table saws, balers, wood chippers, etc.

- Design forts, utilizing existing building and scraps, or creating your own brand new one entirely. For example, you could occupy a house with layers of electrical fences and also have 15 foot wide trenches surrounding them with mines on the bottom.

- Single player about a person trying to live through it. A co-op about maintaining a research post.

- 4 possible random locations for a safehouse, and the players have to rely on the visual clues to actually track down where the safehouse is. 

- City would actually be more open, but still with some locations cutoff from overturned trucks and stuff, to account for some sort of border. 

- Open world type environment, but limited in size. Once they reach a safehouse, they open up access to the next portion of the city. Get from point A to point B or the stay alive in 1 place.

- TONS of zombies in the game to just create tons of epic gaming moments, slow and fast types to feed both sides of the zombie debate. 

- Destructible environments where you could like blow open a building and have it come crashing down onto the streets killing loads of zombies. 

- Real weapons in the game that are customizable with scopes, stalks, clips, lasers, etc, not just the generic assault rifle shotgun sub machine gun no name guns.

- Able to drive every single vehicle, fly planes and helicopters.

- Realistic graphics. 

- A story driven game that is new and creative not a virus from a big company caused a plague of mindless brain eaters. A narrative. Or rather, an overall goal. There wouldn't really be any objective besides scvanging and trying to survive.

- Split screen co-op as well as 4 player on-line. 

- Vehicles vehicles and more vehicles, tanks, cars, trucks, helicopters, boats. 

- To be a very good game though, it would have to be very limited ammo and health/rations. 

- Being in buildings. Blocking off windows is common. Indoors is something that is not common in Sandboxes.

- Player can travel by more than just the main roads. Like Alleyway and through buildings.

- Change the environment and have the changes stay. If the player block a door then the door will be block when he/she return even if the player is being chase by a pack of zombies.

- Story mode: this is the main SP/Co-op that has the story

- Survival: a game to see how long a player or a team can live

- Research helper: a player or a team is to help a team that is researching what is going on. Such as keeping their work area safe, gathering up subject, get any odd item they need, and/or helping them escape/relocated if something happen.

- Quarantine: a player or a team act as a solider that job is to maintain a quarantine line

- Cleanse: the player or team is apart of the army as they clean up the city.

- How to drop the zombies: head shoots only, head shoots is a instance kill and enough shoot would drop the zombie, random target location.

- Medical supplies, food, water, transporation, trustworthy people, weapons, ammo. Like a timezone on how many days and go further go the supplies will began to be harder and harder to find. Moving to town to town avoiding big citiies. Once you get infected you die but you get a new peson to start.
